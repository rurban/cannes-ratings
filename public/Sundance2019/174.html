<tr><td></td><td colspan=2 class=detail><i>&nbsp;&nbsp; -  - Aquarela is a deeply cinematic journey through the transformative beauty and raw power of water. From the precarious frozen waters of Russia’s Lake Baikal to the throes of Hurricane Irma in Miami to Venezuela’s mighty Angel Falls, water is Aquarela’s main character. Director Viktor Kossakovsky captures the element’s many personalities in startling cinematic clarity at 96 frames per second.</i></td></tr>
