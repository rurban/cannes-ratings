INDIE SERIES PROGRAM
Press play whenever you’re ready—these selections are available on-demand throughout the Festival.

"4 Feet High" (María Belén Poncio, Rosario Perazolo Masjoan) [Spotlight]
 Juana, a 17-year-old wheelchair user, aims to explore her sexuality but is ashamed of her body. Trying to find her place in a new high school, she will go through failure, friendship, fear, and politics until she builds her own pride.

#letterboxd

"Seeds of Deceit" (Miriam Guttmann) [Spotlight]
 The revelation that Dr. Karbaat clandestinely used his own semen to inseminate more than 65 of his patients shocked the world. A vivid portrayal of how that happened and all the ways it haunts those affected: the emotional trauma of coming to terms with a changed life, a new identity.

#letterboxd

"These Days" (Adam Brooks) [Spotlight]
 Mae, lonely and self-isolating, navigates the world of online dating during the early days of quarantine. Her first attempt is a comic disaster; then she meets Will, and her
 world begins to change in unexpected ways.

#letterboxd

"Would You Rather" (Lise Akoka, Romane Guéret) [Spotlight]
 Sixteen-year-olds Shaï, Djeneba, Aladi, and Ismaël grew up in a working-class Paris neighborhood. Together, they watch hours drift by, cracking jokes and playing their favorite game, “Would you rather?” As the group’s equilibrium suddenly shifts, they have to start making choices—in their lives.
