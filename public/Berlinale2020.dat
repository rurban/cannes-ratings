#letterboxd

"Kokon" (Leonie Krippendorff, D) [Generation]
 Opener. In the shimmering midsummer days, there are many first times for young Nora from Kreuzberg: menstruating, smoking marijuana, discovering sexual desires. And then there's Romy as well. The two young women, impressively played by Lena Urzendowsky and Jella Haase, gently approach each other.

"Alice Júnior" (Gil Baroni, Bra 2019) [Generation] <i>Venice</i>
 Alice Júnior is trans, confident and ready to confront life. In the new school in the Brazilian province, she is first bullied and then admired. In her struggle for acceptance, her YouTube community is omnipresent, in the comments and emojis on her page, but also all throughout the visual level of the film. IP

#letterboxd

"The Earth Is Blue as an Orange" (Iryna Tsilyk, Ukr/Lit) [Generation]
 The budding filmmaker Myroslava and her family are at home in the middle of the Ukrainian war zone. In the formerly lively environment, emptiness has spread, once familiar things now seem threatening. By re-enacting scenes and telling each other what has happened, the family members process the persistent state of emergency together. 1st, doc

#letterboxd

"Irmã (Sisters in the End of the World)" (Luciana Mazeto, Vinícius Lopes, Bra) [Generation]
 The mother is dying, the father has never cared. The two sisters Ana and Ju, however, remain strong and in solidarity with each other - even if the world around them collapses and asteroids fall from the sky. An experimental road movie in pulsating images, containing ingenious dialogues and songs that reverberate. WP, 1st

#letterboxd

"Jumbo" (Zoé Wittock, D/B/Lux)  [Generation] <i>Sundance</i>
 The shy Jeanne (Noémie Merlant) still lives with her mother. At night, she works in an amusement park. Suddenly, the new attraction Jumbo - a huge idiosyncratic carousel - appears and begins to put the young woman under its spell. A wild and unusual love story unfolds. 1st

#letterboxd

"My Name is Baghdad" (Caru Alves de Souza, Bra) [Generation]
 A film from the skater world of São Paulo, where it is women who call the shots. Bagdá is surrounded by self-confident role models in her family. However, outside on the streets, in the venues and clubs, the old machismo continues to dominate. Bagdá and her fellow comrades-in-arms confront it defiantly. WP

#letterboxd

"Our Lady of the Nile (Notre-Dame de Nil)" (Atiq Rahimi, Fr) [Generation]
 In the microcosm of an elite Catholic school in Rwanda, the contrasts and hostilities between Hutu and Tutsi that are already deeply rooted in society are mirrored by a group of teenage girls. A literary film adaptation, inspired by the real events that forewarn the genocide of the Rwandan Civil War in 1994.

#letterboxd

"Palazzo di Giustizia (Ordinary Justice)" (Chiara Bellosi, Ita/Sui) [Generation]
 While a trial involving murder, manslaughter and armed robbery is being conducted inside the courtroom, the two daughters of the accused are sentenced to wait outside in the hallway. It is the casual, although meaningful moments which are captured that make this portrayal of a very ordinary day at the court truly impressive. WP, 1st

#letterboxd

"Paradise Drifters" (Mees Peijnenburg, NL) [Generation]
 On the edge of Europe's affluent society, in the middle of the concrete jungle, the paths of Yousef, Chloe and Lorenzo intersect. Three homeless young people who combine their silent longing for security with their loud cry for independence.

#letterboxd

"Pompei" (Anna Falguères, John Shank, Bel/Fr/Can) [Generation]
 Swaggering with the coolness of James Dean, the members of a youthful gang exist in a world virtually without adults. Following their own rules, they search in the middle of nowhere for the artefacts of a lost civilization, until the appearance of a young woman changes everything. A powerful story of liberation reminiscent of “Lord of the Flies”.

#letterboxd

"White Riot" (Rubika Shah, UK 2019) [Generation] <i>London</i>
 What kind of democratic resistance can young people offer in times of burgeoning racism? The filmmaker, who herself was faced with racism as a young woman, pursues the forces of the "Rock against Racism" movement in London in the mid-1970s. A movement embodied by the music of The Clash, Steel Pulse and X-Ray Spex. IP, 1st, Doc

#letterboxd

"Kaze no Denwa (Voices in the Wind)" (Nobuhiro Suwa, Japan) [Generation]
 Years after her family was killed in the 2011 tsunami, the quiet Haru, played by the young Japanese star Serena Motola, travels across Japan in search of traces. A calm road movie that collects miniature portraits as painted by encounters, thus becoming the portrait of a society that is still deeply marked by trauma. IP

"La déesse des mouches à feu (Goddess of the Fireflies)" (Anaïs Barbeau-Lavalette, Can) [Generation]
 Following the separation of her parents, 16-year-old Catherine loses her footing. She plunges into life, lets herself be carried away by drugs and music, and finds a new family in a clique of her peers as well as the opportunity for her first sexual encounter. Pure teen spirit, impressively embodied by the high-energy, Canadian actress Kelly Depeault. WP

#letterboxd

"Yalda, la nuit du pardon (Yalda, a Night for Forgiveness)" (Massoud Bakhshi, F/D/Sui/Lux/Lebanon/Iran) [Generation] <i>Sundance</i>
 In the artificial entertainment world of the Iranian TV show “Joy of Forgiveness”, the wronged daughter and a public of millions judge the fate of a young woman who is sentenced to death. Maryam is said to have murdered her much older husband, a man with whom she had lived in a temporary marriage. A tense drama about the power of forgiveness and the women who are doomed to remain prisoners.

Generation Kplus

#letterboxd

"Las niñas (Schoolgirls)" (Pilar Palomero, Spa) [Generation]
 Prodded by the rebellious Brisa, puberty is awakening in twelve-year-old Celia. Quickly, the two become allies against the rigid rules of authority in the Catholic girls’ school. However, questions about the right bra, cool bands and sexy clothing cannot hide the urgent search for their own identity. WP 1st

#letterboxd

"Cuties" (Maïmouna Doucouré, Fr) [Generation] <i>Sundance</i>

Amy Nicholson           https://variety.com/2020/film/reviews/cuties-review-1203476991/

#letterboxd

"Death Of Nintendo" (Raya Martin, Phil/US) [Generation]
 Only something truly earthshaking can keep four 13-year-olds away from their computer games: the eruption of a volcano, the first feelings of falling in love, the dreaded initiation into manhood. Filipino director Raya Martin (Independencia, 2009 WCF and La Última Película, 2014 Forum Expanded) plunges into a dazzling world of the pop culture of the 1990s.

#letterboxd

"H Is For Happiness" (John Sheedy, Aus) [Generation]

#letterboxd

"Los Lobos" (Samuel Kishi Leopo, Mex) [Generation]

"Mamá, mamá, mamá (Mum, Mum, Mum)" (Sol Berruezo Pichon-Riviére, Arg) [Generation]
 A veil of sadness lies over the oppressively hot summer days. Cleo dives into daydreams with her cousins, the girls share secret signs and rituals. Flowing gently, in impressionistic images, the empty space that the death of Cleo’s sister has left in the family is poetically encircled. WP 1st

#letterboxd

"Mugge & vejfesten (Monty and the Street Party)" (Anders Morgenthaler, Mikael Wulff, Den 2019)  [Generation]
 Monty, a cheerful optimist, wants to organise a big neighbourhood party to reconcile his parents shortly before their divorce. Nuns with beards on stilts and enthusiastic parkour nudists, those are part of everyday life in his little town. A breath-taking firework of bizarre and pointed punch lines on the occasion of a hopeless situation. IP, Animation

#letterboxd

"Ochite mi sini, rokljata sharena (Blue Eyes and Colorful My Dress)" (Polina Gumiela, D) [Generation]
  Full of self-confidence, three-year-old Zhana explores her neighbourhood in Plovdiv, Bulgaria. A fresh look at the world, at places and people who fascinate, who make one laugh, who challenge or are challenged by the little explorer. A documentary as an endless chain of little miracles. WP, doc

"Veins Of The World" (Byambasuren Davaa, D/Mon) [Generation]

#letterboxd

"Sthalpuran (Chronicle of Space)" (Akshay Indikar, India) [Generation]
 The move from the city to the country, the disappearance of the father. Nobody explained to Dhigu why this is so. Throughout the summer, the observant boy takes note of his surroundings. Together with Dhigu, the film explores his new place of life in the Indian province, with images of vastness and abundance that become deeply etched into the memory. WP

#letterboxd

"Sune – Best Man" (Jon Holmberg, Swe 2019) [Generation]
 Sune meets himself as a figure from the future, someone who wants to give him the lead on an important decision. But it is in Sune’s family that no one can really make a decision. Aimlessness and inventiveness characterise grandpa, the parents and the children. After Sune vs. Sune, a turbulent family trip with heart, humour and action. IP

 with Nina Schwabe, Theo Trebs, Henning Kober, Anna Manolova, Márton Nagy, Leon Ullrich
 Andrea, a woman without a past, is the object of both Philipp’s and his son’s desire. A love triangle filled with expectations, longing and fears leaves open the speculation of who knows what about whom. WP

#letterboxd

"Garagenvolk (Garage People)" (Natalija Yefimkina) [Perspektive Deutsches Kino]
 In Russia’s unwelcoming north, garages stretch out into endlessness. Behind rusty doors everything can be found, except cars. They are the refuge of the Russian man, the vanishing point out of bleak daily life and a signal of hope for big dreams. WP, doc, 1st

#letterboxd

"Walchensee Forever" (Janna Ji Wonders) [Perspektive Deutsches Kino]
 If there is such a thing as a family memory that carries forward over the course of history, then it determines the actions of every generation. The director tells the story of the women in her family, set amongst Walchensee, the Summer of Love, hippie dreams and the harem surrounding Rainer Langhans. WP, doc, 1st

#letterboxd

"Automotive" (Jonas Heldt)  [Perspektive Deutsches Kino]
 While Sedanur spends the whole night in Ingolstadt sorting car parts, headhunter Eva is looking for specialists in logistics automation. Two very different representatives of a generation in which, sooner or later, everyone will be replaceable. WP, doc, 1st

 with Almila Bagriacik, Zübeyde Bulut, Maryam Boubani, Christoph Letkowski, Gonca de Haas

#letterboxd

"Wagenknecht" (Sandra Kaudelka) [Perspektive Deutsches Kino]

#letterboxd

"Out of Place" (Friederike Güssefeld) [Perspektive Deutsches Kino]
