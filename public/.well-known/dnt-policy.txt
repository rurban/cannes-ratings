Do Not Track Compliance Policy

Version 1.0

This domain complies with user opt-outs from tracking via the "Do Not Track"
or "DNT" header  [http://www.w3.org/TR/tracking-dnt/].  This file will always
be posted via HTTPS at https://cannes-ratings.org/.well-known/dnt-policy.txt
to indicate this fact.

We don't have any login nor registration, we don't send cookies,
we don't store logs.

AGGREGATION:

  a. We may retain and share anonymized datasets, such as aggregate records of
     readership patterns; statistical models of user behavior; graphs of system
     variables; data structures to count active users on monthly or yearly
     bases; non-unique data structures constructed within browsers for tasks
     such as ad frequency capping or conversion tracking; or logs with truncated
     and/or encrypted IP addresses and simplified User Agent strings.

  b. "Anonymized" means we have conducted risk mitigation to ensure
     that the dataset, plus any additional information that is in our
     possession or likely to be available to us, does not allow the
     reconstruction of reading habits, online or offline activity of groups of
     fewer than 5000 individuals or devices.

  c. If we generate anonymized datasets under this exception we will publicly
     document our anonymization methods in sufficient detail to allow outside
     experts to evaluate the effectiveness of those methods.

ADDITIONAL DEFINITIONS

"Reading habits" includes amongst other things lists of visited DNS names, if
those domains pertain to specific topics or activities, but records of visited
DNS names are not reading habits if those domain names serve content of a very
diverse and general nature, thereby revealing minimal information about the
opinions, interests or activities of the user.
