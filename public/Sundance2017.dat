NEW FRONTIER

"18 Black Girls" (Terence Nance) [New Frontier]
 18 Black Girls Boys Ages 1-18 Who Have Arrived at the Singularity and Are Thus Spiritual Machines: $X in an Edition of $97 Quadrillion / U.S.A. (Director and writer: Terence Nance) — In this pair of performances, the artist Googles the phrase "one-year-old black boy" and "one-year-old black girl," ascending in age to 18, allowing Google's "popular searches" algorithm to populate what words will follow.

"Did You Wonder Who Fired the Gun?" (Travis Wilkerson) [New Frontier]
 This documentary murder mystery about the artist’s own family is a Southern Gothic torn apart and reassembled. Journeying straight into the black heart of a family and country, this multimedia performance explores a forgotten killing by the artist's great-grandfather—a white Southern racist—of a black man in lower Alabama.

"World Without End (No Reported Incidents)" (Jem Cohen, U.S.A., United Kingdom) [New Frontier]
 Close observations around Southend-on-Sea, a small English town along the Thames estuary, reveal not only everyday streets, everyday birds, unflagging tides, mud and sky, but also prize-winning Indian curries, an encyclopedic universe of hats and a nearly lost world of proto-punk music.
